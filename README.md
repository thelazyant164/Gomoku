# Gomoku
Using metadata to calculate best move of each turn instead of a minimax algorithm, allowing your match to be lengthy and enjoyable without you being absolutely demolished. 

Features:
- There are several customization options to pick from: difficulty, board dimension, win condition, your mark...

Limit:
- Can only take manual coordinate input at this stage (can be cumbersome)
- Only limit to 26x26 board at maximum (due to each column being indicated by a letter in the alphabet)

Usage:
- "Gomoku" is the source code, written in Python.

Possible future update:
- A GUI interface that allows for more intuitive click-to-select option
- Support for even bigger playing board
